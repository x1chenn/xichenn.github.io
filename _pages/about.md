Hi! I'm **Xi Chen (陈希)**, a first-year **M.S.E. student in Computer Science** at **Johns Hopkins University**, where I work in the [ARCADE Lab](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/) with Dr. Lalithkumar Seenivasan and collaborate with Prof. Laixi Shi and Prof. Jianyi Yang on robust reinforcement learning. Before JHU, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from **Nankai University**.

I am broadly interested in **decision-making and perception for embodied agents**, and I am **applying for a Ph.D.** to pursue this direction. My current research focuses on:

- 🌍 **Generative World Models for Robust RL** — Investigating how diffusion models and flow matching can serve as trajectory-level world models for offline reinforcement learning, enabling multi-step value expansion without compounding prediction error. I am particularly interested in grounding these models in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to handle dynamics shift at deployment, with extensions toward multi-agent robust planning via RTG-conditioned joint trajectory generation.
- 👁️ **Visual Foundation Models for Embodied & Surgical Agents** — Developing point tracking and spatiotemporal correspondence models that remain reliable under challenging endoscopic conditions (specular highlights, low-texture tissue, rapid motion). I am interested in how robust perception backbones can be composed with world models and action policies to support long-horizon planning in surgical robotics and embodied AI.

Earlier work spans time-series learning, generative modeling, and computer vision. I enjoy problems where robust decision-making meets real deployment constraints.

## selected research projects

**Adversarial Finetuning of Generative World Models for Distributionally Robust Offline RL** &nbsp; <span style="color: var(--global-text-color-light)">· Apr 2026 – Present</span>

_Johns Hopkins University — with Prof. Laixi Shi, Prof. Jianyi Yang, and Jiaqi Wen_

A robust offline-RL framework pairing **flow-matching trajectory generation** with **distributionally robust optimization (DRO)**: the generative module rolls out _H_-step futures for long-horizon target-Q estimation beyond one-step Bellman backups, while a DRO objective optimizes against worst-case trajectory distributions — yielding strong robustness under dynamics shift versus standard offline-RL baselines.
<span style="color: var(--global-text-color-light)">_In preparation — targeting ICLR 2027._</span>

**Point Tracking for Bronchoscopy via Adjacent-Frame Correlation** &nbsp; <span style="color: var(--global-text-color-light)">· Feb 2026 – Present</span>

_ARCADE Lab, Johns Hopkins University — with Dr. Lalithkumar Seenivasan_

An AllTracker-style tracker adapted to bronchoscopy, where textureless airway walls, illumination shifts, and specular reflections break long-range query-anchored matching. An **adjacent-frame correlation** module estimates and chains frame-to-frame optical flow for robust tracking, distilled (Transformer teacher → lightweight CNN student with D2-Net-style features) for real-time deployment at **< 30 ms latency**.

**Backdoor Attacks on Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting** &nbsp; <span style="color: var(--global-text-color-light)">· Dec 2024 – May 2025</span>

_Undergraduate thesis, DBIS Lab, Nankai University — with Dr. Xiangrui Cai_

A stealthy backdoor-attack framework for multivariate forecasting under realistic missing-value scenarios: invisible triggers at missing-value positions plus a critical-time-step imputation strategy preserve stealth while cutting attack MAE by **43%** versus baselines.
